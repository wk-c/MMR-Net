This repository contains the official implementation of the paper “Deep Learning–Based Spatiotemporal Estimation of Lesion Changes for Patient-Level Assessment of Breast Cancer Lung Metastases on Longitudinal CT.”
The proposed MMR (Multi-scale MedSAM-assisted Recurrent) network provides a registration-free deep learning framework for assessing longitudinal lesion evolution and treatment response in breast cancer lung metastasis based on serial CT images.
It integrates a visual foundation model–assisted segmentation module (pMedSAM), a multi-scale adaptive weighting module (MAW), and a recurrent spatiotemporal analysis network to capture lesion changes over time.
This implementation enables robust and automated patient-level lesion assessment, improving consistency and efficiency in clinical treatment monitoring.
